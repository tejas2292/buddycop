In this project we will be solving two major issues faced by police :
1)Allocation and monitoring of Police Resources,
2)Crime Visualization and Analytics.

So the app is completely ready with all the functionalities mentioned in this video. the app’s apk is given in the form of a drive link and the github project link is also provided.
# Getting started with the Idea :
First we will log in as the admin of the police department which will be managed by the IT Cell’s admin of Police Dept (Control Room Officer). The admin can create, allocate sectors to every police officers from Sector Head to Constables / any required designation officer. 
So as we click on the Create Sector, we will enter the Sector Area Name and the coordinates of the respective sector. For example purpose we have taken radius of the sector as 1km (we can even edit that according to our need).
Then we can allocate the Head officers according to their ranks in respective sectors.
Similarly we can allocate other officers too according to their designated sectors.
Now, Admin also have the access to enter the criminals and those Criminals will be displayed as “wanted” to all the users of the app.

So, now we will login as the sector head whose respective designated sector and rank of the officer will be displayed. The Sector Head has the authority to take attendance of other junior police officers and so does his/her head.
. . .

So now we will click the self attendance tab to mark our self attendance
Oh k now we understood that your location was not in the circle so your attendance was not marked so when we logout from this account and go to the account and area which is assigned to us we can see that we are in the fenced location and our attendance gets marked .
So basically whenever the police official is in the fenced area then only his attendance will be marked and if he is not he his attendance will not be , so this is how self attendance marking and allocation will work hand in hand . When talking about having no network we will also be having an offline option where the senior officials can mark their attendance manually in the app and their officers will in turn do the same .
….
To map the different type of crimes with real time data,first we will file an FIR and enter the FIR No., Victim Name, type of offence, place of offence, coordinates and the witness name if any found.
Then we will go to the Crime map and the recent FIR entered will get tagged on the map with the marker with respect to the offense & we can even get the directions to reach the crime scene . Here as we have entered the type of crime as car crash and the place of crime as Kharadi, so we got a marker of car crash with location specified. Hence this will save the precious time of police officials to reach the crime scenes as quick as possible without any confusions.

# Our future plans of implementation :
By the valuable feedback of the organizers we will be implementing the blockchain concept in the FIR filling system so that no hackers or even the officers cannot tamper with the data as if any of the fir data is tampered, this would result in invalid hash and everyone would come to know .
We will also be adding the feature of downloading the complete report and this will be handy in many features . 

Thanks for the support provided by every coordinators in the hackathon.
